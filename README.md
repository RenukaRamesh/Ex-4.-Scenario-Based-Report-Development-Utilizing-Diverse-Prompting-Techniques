Objective: The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation.
## Aim: 
To evaluate how diverse AI prompting techniques can be applied to create an effective scenario-based customer service chatbot for a retail environment, and to compare the quality of responses generated through these different prompting methods.

## Algorithm: 
Step 1: Problem & Scenario Definition

Define research objective: improving customer experience with an AI chatbot.

Identify key scenarios:

Product availability inquiry

Order tracking

Returns/refunds

Complaint handling

Personalized recommendations

Step 2: Prompting Technique Selection

List diverse prompting techniques.

For each scenario, decide which prompting method to test:

Simple fact-based query → Zero-shot / Few-shot

Complex reasoning → Chain-of-Thought / Self-Consistency

Emotional/empathetic queries → Role-based / Persona-based

Critical tasks → Hybrid prompting

Step 3: Experiment Design

Create datasets of customer queries (simulate real retail interactions).

For each query, generate responses using multiple prompting techniques.

Record:

Accuracy

Empathy

Conciseness

Customer satisfaction (simulated rating)

Response time

Step 4: Data Collection

Store all chatbot responses.

Annotate outputs with evaluation metrics.

Use feedback (human raters / simulated ratings) to assess quality.

Step 5: Analysis

Compare techniques across metrics.

Identify strengths/weaknesses per scenario.

e.g., Chain-of-Thought better for refunds, Role-based better for empathy.

Use statistical or comparative analysis (accuracy %, average satisfaction).

Step 6: Report Generation

Structure report into sections:

Introduction

Literature Review

Methodology

Prompting Techniques Overview

Experiment Scenarios

Data Collection & Results

Analysis & Discussion

Challenges & Limitations

Future Work

Conclusion

For each section, generate content using targeted prompting techniques:

Zero-shot → general background

Few-shot → detailed explanations with examples

Chain-of-thought → structured reasoning in methodology/results

Persona-based → customer experience case studies

Step 7: Refinement & Validation

Validate report consistency (no contradictions, well-structured).

Apply self-consistency prompting to refine unclear sections.

Cross-check results with retail case studies.

Step 8: Final Output

Export structured Scenario-Based Report (PDF/Word).

Document how each prompting technique contributed to different sections.

## Result:
The experiment shows that AI-powered chatbots in retail perform best when using hybrid prompting strategies. The scenario-based report demonstrates how different prompting techniques can be applied in research, experimentation, and professional documentation, leading to improved customer experience, accuracy, and clarity.
